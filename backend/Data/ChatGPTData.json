        "content": "Feeling anxious and overwhelmed during finals is common, but there are several strategies you can use to help manage your stress: 1. Create a Study Schedule: Break down your study material into manageable chunks and create a schedule. Prioritize your tasks and stick to your plan. 2. Take Breaks: Regular breaks are essential for maintaining focus and preventing burnout. Use techniques like the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes of studying followed by a 5-minute break). 3. Practice Relaxation Techniques: Deep breathing exercises, meditation, and mindfulness can help reduce anxiety. Apps like Headspace or Calm offer guided meditations. 4. Stay Organized: Keep your study space tidy and organized. Having a clear workspace can help you feel more in control and focused. 5. Exercise Regularly: Physical activity can help alleviate stress and improve your mood. Even a short walk or a quick workout can make a difference. 6. Get Enough Sleep: Prioritize getting a good night’s sleep. Avoid staying up too late studying, as lack of sleep can increase stress and reduce cognitive function. 7. Eat Healthily: Maintain a balanced diet and stay hydrated. Avoid excessive caffeine and sugary snacks. 8. Seek Support: Don’t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a counselor if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Many universities offer counseling services for students. 9. Stay Positive: Remind yourself that it’s normal to feel stressed, and that you’ve prepared as best as you can. Focus on positive self-talk and affirmations. 10. Stay Positive: Remind yourself that it’s normal to feel stressed, and that you’ve prepared as best as you can. Focus on positive self-talk and affirmations. Remember, it’s important to take care of yourself and find a balance between studying and relaxation."

The floors creaked and the windows leaked and the oven door wouldn’t close—but I loved the place. It felt cozy and funky and just the right size for my downsized life. Then, after I’d lived there about six months, my landlord stopped by to tell me he had a buyer for the house. “But I like it here,” I said, “and I’m in the middle of a divorce.” Dan and I sat on the grass in the back yard and talked awhile and finally he stood up. “I went through a divorce,” he said. “I won’t sell the house.” I stayed for five years, and figured out how to keep the oven door closed with a hanger and a rubber band. Also how to be a single mom, a single woman. I grappled with guilt and grief and unintended consequences—losing extended family, people taking sides. A roller-coaster, a slog. And if something went wrong with the house, I called my landlord. When he had to retrieve my pantyhose from the bathtub drain, Dan laughed and said, “Not hard enough.” When the birds in the attic turned out to be a battery in the smoke detector, he said, “Not hard enough.” When a stray cat came to our back porch and my daughter wanted to keep it, he changed the rule about “No Pets.” After we moved out, Dan sold the house. I still drive by. There’s a stroller out front these days and a pot of red geraniums."

However, after learning about the narrator's divorce, he decided not to sell the house. Over the next five years, the narrator navigated the challenges of being a single mother and woman, finding solace in the support and flexibility provided by Dan. He allowed them to stay, helped with house issues, and even changed the rules to accommodate their needs. After they moved out, Dan eventually sold the house, but the narrator still drives by and notices signs of a new family living there."

The coat closet had a stained glass window in blue and gold and violet. I know that place by heart and can still stand in each room and picture the furnishings: the Victorian couch, the console radio, the four-poster twin beds upstairs. As a child, I often stayed overnight and it was a refuge from the confusions of my own home—my mother’s sadness, my father’s rage. Before I went to sleep, Nanna sat on the edge of the bed in her long nightgown and we talked awhile. “Are you warm enough?” she’d ask. Looking back, I realize my grandparents’ house was modest in size but it seemed huge to me. Huge and calm and welcoming. In the living room, I sat beside Grandpa and listened to him read Longfellow’s poem, The Song of Hiawatha. I liked the way the words made music. In the dining room, our family gathered for special meals, using the good dishes from the big mahogany breakfront. Nanna always told the grandchildren, “Don’t eat any more than you want.” Which meant you could take an extra biscuit and not finish it. It meant you had permission to be yourself, something I didn’t feel anywhere else. Permission to sit on the floor of the coat closet in the dark and feel safe—watching the light come through the colored glass."
